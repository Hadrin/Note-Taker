## Description
Created by: [David McGinley](https://github.com/Hadrin)

Note Taker is a webserver application which allows users to collaboratively write, save, load, and delete notes. The "database" is run from a .json file which can be interacted with via the server's api. The front end of the application uses this api to expose functionality to the user.

## Installation
Just run npm i to install any required packages. npm start will spin up a locally hosted webserver.

## Usage
Once the "Get Started" button is clicked the user is taken to the notes page which is automatically populated with any existing notes in the db.json. Users can create a new note by clicking on the plus button at the top right, and filling out the blank note that appears. Users can retrieve the text content of a note by clicking on the title on the left part of the screen. The red trashcan button will permenantly delete a note from the server.
